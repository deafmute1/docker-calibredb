  cron-copyjob.sh for deafmute1/docker_calibredb v2.1
  Ethan Djeric <me@ethandjeric.com>

  Monitors a source path for new files in some time interim, and copies new files to given directories. 
  Includes logic to match top level directory hierarchies between source and destination.
  Intended to be used with environmental variable DELETE_IMPORTED=true in calibredb, and with interim 
  matching a cron job calling the script. Also can be used with other servers such as komga.
  
  Usage: /path/to/cron-copyjob.sh INTERIM SOURCE [OPTION(S)]

  INTERIM and SOURCE are required, in addition to one or more of -m or -d.

  Positional Arguments:
  INTERIM      Time (in minutes) to look for new files (i.e. crontab job timer)
  SOURCE       Absolute path to a source directory, intended to be a top level directory to some high level
                directory containing subfolders with trees of unlimted depth that are flattened and move to one 
                or more destinations.

  Optional Arguments:
  -h, --help                    Print this information.

  -m,--matchsubs [PATH]         Absolute path to a top level directory to copy files at *(2) in SOURCE/*(1)/*(2) to 
                                PATH/*(1)/*(2), where any files in subfolders of *(2) are flattened into *(2) and copied.

  -d, --directdir [SUBDIR] [DIR]  Just copy flattened files from [SUBDIR] (a directory in SOURCE), to some absolute path 
                                  specifed by [DIR]

  --debug                         Enable debug settings (just set -x at this point)
